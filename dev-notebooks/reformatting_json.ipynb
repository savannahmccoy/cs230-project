So let me review the one I got.\\n\\nThis is the new smaller design, a little bigger than a DVD case. While it may look cool, it is NOT recommended. The only pro is how cool it looks.\\n\\nThe CONS:\\n\\nWill accept PS1 Memory cards and old PS2 Memory cards BUT will not let you use them until you reformat them. This means if you wanted to continue that game you had saved on there, DON\\'T COUNT ON IT.\\n\\nThe door for the game tray is a flip up instead of a drawer. You\\'d think they\\'d have learned not to go back to this since their last design failed so frequently with this function.\\n\\nThe only reason you should get this Playstation is if:\\n\\nA - You have never owned a Playstation before\\n\\nB - You have no friends that own Playstations (so you won\\'t have to worry about bringing games over eachothers places, or showing your pal where you are on the game via his Playstation)\\n\\nC - You don\\'t intend on playing your old games on the new system, in any way shape or form. (Except by starting at the beginning and replaying the game all over again).\\n\\nMaybe I seem a little bitter, but my main grudge is that I just got home from playing a game I started at a friends house, put 4 hours of work into, then brought home. Then I popped the memory card in, played for another 4 hours (all the while, saving and having the playstation tell me it saved successfully).. when I realized that the game I was \"overwriting\" was actually the same game over and over. It never overwrote anything. So now, when I turn off my playstation, there goes 4 hours of work.\\n\\nAnd what happens when I put in the NEW PS2 Formatted Memory card to see if I can save on that? oh HELL NO. Ofcourse not, it won\\'t even recognize the memory card while the game is still in.\\n\\nThanks a lot Playstation. Atleast if my new XBox screws up, I can save it to the hard drive. Jerks.',\n",
